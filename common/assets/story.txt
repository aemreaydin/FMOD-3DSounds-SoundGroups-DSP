On Saturday, Ashley and her friends went on a hike at the Yosemite National Park. They brought her dog with them. 
As they hiked the track, they could hear birds chirping. They could also hear a hawk cry occasionally.

After a couple of hours walking, they found a small stream that leads to a lake. Some of them started jumping into the lake to swim, 
some start playing with the ducks nearby and some tried to catch some frogs.

Night time came and they set up a camp. They made some fire to provide them with light and warmth. As they were having dinner, they tell stories
and joked around.
